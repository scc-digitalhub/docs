Repository for the documentation of the platform. The documentation features multiple portals, aimed at different audiences (`user`, `dev`, ...).

To create a new page (the following example refers to the `user` portal, but the process for others is equivalent):

- Write a *.md* file within `user/docs`
- Add it to the `nav` element in `/user/mkdocs.yml`

Commit your changes and the website will automatically be updated within a couple minutes.

## Test locally

If you wish to test your changes locally before pushing, the quickest way to do so is:

Install MkDocs and mkdocs-material:
```sh
pip install mkdocs
pip install mkdocs-material
```

Remove `custom_dir: ../custom/` from `base.yml` (this file concerns CSS, so things like colours will be different). If not removed, you may receive an error when performing the next step. Make sure not to include this change in your later commit.

Run the following from the `/user` (or equivalent for whichever portal you're testing) directory:
```sh
mkdocs serve
```

You can then view the docs at `localhost:8000`. As the docs on the website are generated by combining multiple portals, you will be missing any portal other than the one you are testing.

## Versioned documentation

Different versions of the documentation may be available at once.

The `current` version of the documentation reflects the most up-to-date state of the `main` branch, and is updated when new commits to `main` are made. It can be found under `/docs`.

Publishing a new branch will generate another documentation portal, named after the branch, under `/docs/<branch_name>`. Further pushes to this branch will update the corresponding portal.

## Adding a portal

The documentation can feature multiple portals, such as `User` and `Dev`, aimed at different purposes, which can be accessed from a drop-down menu in the toolbar.

If you wish to add another portal, follow the steps below. This example will configure a new portal, called `Example`, available under the `/example` sub-path.

At root level, create a new directory named `example`. Inside, create a `mkdocs.yml` file, and a directory called `docs`, with an `index.md` file within, as follows:

```
example/
├── mkdocs.yml
└── docs/
    └── index.md
```

The contents of `mkdocs.yml` should be:

``` yaml
INHERIT: ../base.yml
site_url: http://docs/example

extra:
  portal_name: Example

extra_css:
  - !ENV [OTHERS_STYLESHEETS_PORTAL_SELECTION, "../stylesheets/portal_selection.css"]
  - !ENV [OTHERS_STYLESHEETS_COLORS, "../stylesheets/colors.css"]

nav:
  - "index.md"
```

Of course, you can add more *.md* files to expand your documentation.

Next, you must edit the `base.yml` file (found at the root), to expand the `extra.portals` list with your new portal. Note that `name` must be the same as `portal_name`, and `path` must be the same as the directory you created (prefixed with `/`).

``` yaml
extra:
  # [...]
  portals:
    - name: User
      path: ""
    - name: Dev
      path: "/dev"
    - name: Example    # Same as portal_name
      path: "/example" # Same as directory's name, prefixed with /
```

Finally, you must update the `.github/workflows/update-docs.yaml` file, which defines the GitHub workflow, where some commands must be added.

It may seem complicated, but all you have to do is duplicate the equivalent `dev` commands and adapt them for your new portal. The example below highlights these sections.

``` sh
# First here...
git checkout $v
cd user && mkdocs build && cd ..
cd dev && mkdocs build && cd ..
cd example && mkdocs build && cd .. # new line
mkdir -p ./site
mv user/site site/$v
mv dev/site site/$v/dev
mv example/site site/$v/example # new line

# and then a few lines later...
git checkout main
cd user && mkdocs build && cd ..
cd dev && mkdocs build && cd ..
cd example && mkdocs build && cd .. # new line
mv user/site ./site
mv dev/site site/dev
mv example/site site/example # new line
```

Once you commit these changes, your new portal will be available.
